# student-portal

A basic student portal application on python flask which was made as an fyp. in this app, first you have to get yourself registered at "/register" page or simply login on "/login" page if you already have an account, it will redirect you to "/dashboard" page.
On dashboard you can enroll in any avaliable course there or unenroll if you are already enrolled.
Once you enroll, it will show you some pdf books to download related to your course.
There is also a page "/progress" to show student's academic record but all the data is static on that page atm.
At "/settings", you can change your name, email, username, password etc.
enjoy :)
